jForest has been developed by Jérôme Paul
(Machine Learning Group (MLG) - Institute of Information and Communication
Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics (ICTEAM)) for the
Université catholique de Louvain (UCL). jForest is a general framework for
Machine Learning. It implements tree ensemble based classification methods.
It is designed to be very modular and allows easy tuning and modification of
the tree induction, classification criterion and feature importance index.
